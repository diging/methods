AB To compare the role of JNK signaling pathway in rat liver regeneration (LR) and in rat acute hepatic failure (AHF) occurrence at the gene transcription level, Rat Genome 230 2.0 array was used to detect the gene expression profiles of the two processes, and bioinformatics and systems biology methods were applied to analyze the physiological activities uncovered by their gene expression profiles in this study. The results showed that 240 genes were included in the array above, though there were 302 genes related to forty two paths of JNK signaling pathway. Array detection results demonstrated that 52 genes were significantly expressed during LR, 20 genes in AHF occurrence, and 15 genes in both of above two processes. Synergy values of these genes were calculated using a mathematical model established by our lab, which revealed the following. The cell proliferation-promoting effects of paths 1, 16 and paths 1-17 of JNK signaling pathway were stronger than the control at 6-12 h and 72 h of LR, respectively, while the cell proliferation-promoting effects of paths 1-17 and the cell proliferation-inhibiting effects of path 34-35 were weaker at 6h of AHF occurrence. The cell apoptosis-promoting effects of paths 22-23 were much stronger at 6, 12 and 72 h of LR and at 12, 24 h of AHF occurrence. In conclusion, thirty eight paths of JNK signaling pathway regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in both LR and AHF occurrence.
